# repo-template-r
This is a template repository for data science projects done in R.

### Using this template
To use the following template, click the "Use This Template button" and follow the instructions to create a new repository. Fill out the information below, deleting parts that are not specific to your project (e.g., this section). This template is set up to contain shared functions/information in the *0 files, and for individual investigations to be performed in the other files (e.g., see `11-load-demo.Rmd`.  The *0 notebooks therefore have `html_document` output (i.e., html files are not automatically created on save), whereas other notebooks should have `html_notebook` outputs (again, see `11-load-demo.Rmd`).

See the box-authentication notebook if you need to do authentication via Box (for projects with security contracts or PII data). Note that this authentication method works on ACCRE, but proceed with caution.

# Goal
Provide an overview of the goals and deliverables of the project. Mention any relevant details or issues. 

# Background  

Provide a broad overview of the purpose of the project.

# Data

List any data sources here.

## Data security

If there are any security concerns or requirements regarding the data, they should be described here.

## Counts

Describe the overall size of the dataset and the relative ratio of positive/negative examples for each of the response variables.

# Models

Clearly identify each of the response variables of interest.  Any additional desired analysis should also be described here.

# Timeline and Deliverables

Provide a timeline for the project and deadlines for specific deliverables.

# Repo Structure

Give a description of how the repository is structured. Example structure description below:

The repo is structured as follows: All *0- (e.g., 10-, 20-, 30-) files contain finalized work for the purpose described (e.g., "process-data"). Subfiles related to the task (e.g., 11-, 12-) should be created in order to explore and document relevant or interesting subtasks.

All files which appear in the repo should be able to run, and not contain error or blank cell lines, even if they are relatively midway in development of the proposed task. All notebooks relating to the analysis should have a numerical prefix (e.g., 31-) followed by the exploration (e.g. 31-text-labeling). Any utility notebooks should not be numbered, but be named according to their purpose. All notebooks should have lowercase and hyphenated titles (e.g., 10-process-data not 10-Process-Data). All notebooks should adhere to literate programming practices (i.e., markdown writing to describe problems, assumptions, conclusions) and provide adequate although not superfluous code comments.
