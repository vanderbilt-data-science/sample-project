The purpose of this series is to load and clean the data.  It should also test the data (e.g., by assertr) to ensure that assumptions about the data are met, and store the cleaned and tested data.

This file will contain all common functions to the rest of the 10 series notebooks.

```{r load data read packages}
# Use pacman to conveniently load libraries
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")

# load common
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, haven, janitor, lubridate, assertr, vroom, boxr, fs)
```
