> Loading demo data

This notebook provides a simple template for loading the data, and purling and sourcing the common functions found in 10.  The purled R script should be deleted during development so as to ensure that this file is not versioned and used while the original Rmd receives relevant changes.  The header also demonstrates a nice format for the printed html document.

```{r import 10-base functions}
source(knitr::purl('10-load-data.Rmd'))
fs::file_delete('10-load-data.R')
```
